# UFO-s

## Overview

This project aims to build a dynamic web page using JavaScript to visualize UFO data. UfO data comes with various columns, Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments. The webpage has a filtering feature to filter the table based on criteria that the customer enters into the fields.

## Results

To filter the search. In the form portion of the webpage at the bottom left, there are five fields to narrow the search results, including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. All of them could be used separately or together for this purpose.

# Summary

One drawback of the filtering function is it can not handle uppercase, and another is it can not filter multiple options in each field. For example, you can not filter column City to show two different cities simultaneously.

For further improvements, with more than solving the mentioned drawbacks, I recommend adding functionality to the "Apply" button. After filling each field, it shows how many results are available with this criteria.
